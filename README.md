# Chemical Supply Table - A challenge for UI Design

Created a Chemical Table Webpage Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal of this challenge was to demonstrate strong UI design, coding ability, and problem-solving skills by building an interactive and sortable table of chemical supplies using only HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript without using any external framework.

## Problem Statement

The task required building a UI containing a table that displays a list of chemicals and their details. The table includes sorting functionality for each column, and toolbar features to add, delete, edit, move, and save rows of data. The dataset, containing 15 chemical entries, is generated in a JSON format.

## Design Approach and Code Choices

### User Interface Design

The design focuses on simplicity and clarity. The table layout was built using HTML elements with styling applied via CSS, focusing on responsive design principles to ensure usability across different screen sizes.

- Table Design: A grid structure was chosen, which is familiar to users and easy to navigate. Each row represents one chemical record, and sorting icons are incorporated into the header cells for a clear, intuitive sorting mechanism.
- Toolbar: Located at the top of the table for simple access, the toolbar provides rapid access to the main features (add, move, delete, save, and refresh). A simple button design with legible text

### Technical Decisions

- HTML: used to provide semantic clarity, the table structure was built using standard HTML components like <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, and <tr>.
- CSS: Custom CSS was written for styling the table and toolbar. Emphasis was placed on readability and simplicity, avoiding over-complication with heavy styles. Responsive design was achieved using media queries.
- JavaScript: The core logic for handling table actions (sorting, editing, row movement, etc.) was implemented in plain JavaScript to meet the challenge's requirements. Careful consideration was given to: Sorting Mechanism, and Editing Functionality.
- Data Management (JSON): The chemical data was represented via a JSON array. An object in this array is represented by each row in the table. This method guarantees compliance with export and save features while streamlining data management.

### Hosting and Repository

The project is hosted as a static website on GitHub Pages and the codebase is available in a public repository on GitHub.

Thank you for reviewing this submission. I look forward to discussing it in further detail during the next round of the interview process.
